    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze a large random sample of Citibike data from the years 2013 to 2019. We will look at different trends between location and month, as well as trends in the type of users and so much more. Hopefully after reading this tutorial, you will not only be able to understand more about different statistics/trends about the Citibike data, but also how much Citibike has become integrated in the lives of New Yorkers."

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the data collection phase of the data life cycle. During this phase, our focus is on collecting and transforming the data into a usable form. In our case, that usable form is a pandas dataframe derived from a CSV file containing the original data. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing a lot of research for a dataset, we started to look towards the travel industry for motivation. We were motivated by data that contained information regarding ride sharing. At the end, we finalized our search on publicly available bike sharing data from Citi Bike NYC. We retrieved the data from the following site: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html?fbclid=IwAR3BJ9yWYcKtBRYUMQq2SI1IZR9AnFel3C-eTato4mWXtwBz4olhrdrai7Js\n",
    "\n",
    "The company had available several months worth of data, ranging from June of 2013 to October of 2019, so we decided to explore each of these months. In attempting to utilize the data from the entire data range mentioned, we needed to perform several steps to automate the download and collection process. The following process will describe how we went about collecting and manipulating the data into one aggregate dataframe containing a certain number of entries of each date. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect and store the data, we used the following libraries from above:\n",
    "1. urllib\n",
    "2. zipfile\n",
    "3. pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, the data was organized by year, and then month, so it was quite predictable in terms of figuring out how to extract the data files from the site. However, there were some unique aspects that required some workarounds. We looped through each year and month pair from June of 2013 to October of 2019. All of the month numbers in the file names had 2 digits, so we need to make sure all months before October (10th month) were **prepended with a \"0\"**. Most of the zip files followed the format **\"{date}{month_2_digit}-citibike-tripdata.zip\"**. The remaining zip files had a slightly different name format of **\"{date}{month_2_digit}-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip\"**. To get work around this, we instituted a check in the loop to determine if the current year was after 2016. If so, then the url and zip file name would be updated accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once those alterations were completed, as necessary, we proceeded to download the file data. To do so, we utilized the library function **urllib.request.urlretrieve** to download the zip file, indicated by the corresponding url, to the corresponding file path location, which was the current directory in this case. With the zip file downloaded, we proceeded to extract the contents of the zip file, only one CSV file in this case, using zipfile **extractall** method and extracted it to the current directory. We also retrieved the name of the file using the zipfile **namelist** and indexing at 0, as there is always only one element (CSV file) in said list. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "With the CSV data file download and extracted from the corresponding zip file, we transferred it into a pandas dataframe object. We made sure to add year and moth column to differentiate these data points from entries in future CSV files. After that, we decided to add only a sample of the resulting dataframe to our aggregate dataframe. This was due to the fact there were too many entries in every CSV file, so it would be impractical and inefficient to collect every data from each CSV for exploratory data analysis. With that in mind, we decided to randomly sample 10000 rows from each dataframe to be used for data analysis using the pandas **sample** method without replacement. In sampling with n=10000, we get a good representation of the data for that specific date.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "One issue we ran into when generating each sampled dataframe was with the column (attribute) names. We realized that, after approximately 2017, the attribute names were capitalized. Due to this difference, the resulting aggregate dataframe at first contained many NaNs because pandas concatenates dataframes based on their column names. The dataframe resulted in having 2 times the normal amount of column names: half being lowercase and half being capitalized. Ignoring case, the column names across all CSV files were identical. To work around this, we decided to create a list of default, lowercase column names, **col_names**, and replaced the column names of each sampled dataframe with our list. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "After iterating over each date, we ended up with a **list of 77 dataframes**, each corresponding to a specific date from the data. Since, we made sure that all of these dataframes had the same column names, we proceeded to concatenate all of them into one aggregate dataframe, as mentioned before. With 77 dataframes, each with 10000 randomly sampled data points, the new aggregate dataframe contained **770001** total data points. To do this, we utilized the pandas **concat** function, because it we could pass an iterable, which, in this case, was our list of sampled dataframes. The resulting dataframe was returned as output for display purposes."
